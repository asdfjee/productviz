            <h2>Our Process</h2>
            <p>Our service combines your photos with cutting-edge AI technology and a touch of human artistry to create a compelling visualization. Here’s a breakdown of the steps:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>You Submit Your Order:</strong> You provide us with a clear photo of your space and a photo of the furniture or product you're interested in. The product photo can be from a retail website or one you've taken yourself.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>AI-Powered Analysis:</strong> Our system analyzes your room's photo to understand its dimensions, lighting, and perspective. It then analyzes the product photo to create a digital model of the item.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Manual Review & Artistry:</strong> This is our secret sauce! A member of our design team reviews the AI-generated placement. They make crucial adjustments to lighting, shadows, and scale to ensure the final image looks as natural and believable as possible.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Final Delivery:</strong> Once we're satisfied with the result, we render the final high-quality image or video. We then deliver it directly to you via the email or text number you provided. The entire process typically takes 2-3 business days.</li>
            </ol>
