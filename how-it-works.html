                    <strong>Step 1: You Send Us Your Photos.</strong><br>
                    You start by uploading a photo of your space. Then, you either upload a photo of the exact furniture you like or simply describe the item or style you're imagining.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Step 2: Our Designers Get to Work.</strong><br>
                    This is where the magic happens! A real person from our design team takes your request. Using our special software, we create a realistic 3D version of the furniture and place it into your photo. We carefully match the lighting, shadows, and scale to make it look like it's really there.

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 3: You Receive Your Custom Visualization.</strong><br>
                    Within 2-3 business days, we send the final, high-quality image or video directly to your email or phone. You can then see exactly how the new furniture will look in your home!
